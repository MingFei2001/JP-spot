# Osaka 大阪

![Osaka](./media/osaka/osaka-banner.jpg)

Osaka is Japan's kitchen and the heart of Kansai culture. Known for its food scene, friendly locals, and vibrant street life, it's where you'll find takoyaki vendors on every corner and neon-lit entertainment districts that stay busy well past midnight. The city balances modern urban energy with historical sites like Osaka Castle, while districts like Dotonbori and Shinsekai offer distinctly different flavors of local life. It's less polished than Tokyo but more approachable, making it a good base for exploring the Kansai region.

**Main spot types:** Street food, nightlife, shopping, historical sites
