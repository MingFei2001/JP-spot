# JP-spot

A collection of Japan travel spots, organized by region.

This repository is for personal reference and planning. Each region has its own markdown file listing notable places, experiences, and tips.

## Regions

- [Tokyo](./Tokyo.md)
- [Osaka](./Osaka.md)
- [Kyoto](./Kyoto.md)

---

Each link leads to a markdown file with travel spots for that region.

## How to Use

Browse the region files to find spots of interest. Add your own notes or update the lists as you discover new places.

## Future Plans

- Add more regions as I travel.
- Include photos and maps.
- Add personal ratings and comments for each spot.
