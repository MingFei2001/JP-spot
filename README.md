# Japan Travel Spots

*A quiet collection of places I'd like to visit in Japan*

I save interesting Japanese spots I find online here—usually from social media posts or travel blogs that pop up in my feed. This repository is where I keep them organized, mostly for my own reference, but perhaps they'll be useful to someone else who stumbles upon this.

These aren't comprehensive guides or must-see lists—just places that made me pause while scrolling, for whatever reason. Some are well-known, others less so. All seemed worth bookmarking for a future trip.

## About this collection

Started this mainly because I kept losing track of interesting places I'd seen online. Each file contains spots I've collected from various sources—nothing fancy, just locations and brief descriptions with occasional notes from people who've actually been there.

The organization is pretty loose. Places are added as I find them, not in any particular order. Since these come from online sources, I can't vouch for accuracy of details like opening hours. Always double-check practical info before making plans.

If you're planning a trip and find something useful here, great. If you've been to these places and have thoughts to share, even better. I add to this as I discover new places online—sometimes several in a week, other times months go by with nothing new.

Eventually I might include photos from travelers, maps, or more detailed notes. For now, it's useful for planning trips and daydreaming about travel.

Feel free to use whatever seems helpful here. Whether you visit these places or just enjoy imagining them, sometimes the planning is half the fun. Safe travels.
