# Japan Travel Spots

*A quiet collection of places I'd like to visit in Japan*

I save interesting Japanese spots I find online here—usually from social media posts or travel blogs that pop up in my feed. This repository is where I keep them organized, mostly for my own reference, but perhaps they'll be useful to someone else who stumbles upon this.

These aren't comprehensive guides or must-see lists—just places that made me pause while scrolling, for whatever reason. Some are well-known, others less so. All seemed worth bookmarking for a future trip.

## Destinations

- [Tokyo](./kanto/Tokyo.md) - The capital's many faces
- [Osaka](./kansai/Osaka.md) - Good food and friendly people
- [Kyoto](./kansai/Kyoto.md) - Old temples and quiet gardens

- [Hokkaido](./others/Hokkaido.md) - Northern landscapes and fresh air
- [Okinawa](./others/Okinawa.md) - Island time and clear waters

## A few notes

Each file contains places I've collected online, along with whatever details seemed worth saving at the time. Nothing fancy—just locations, brief descriptions, and the occasional note from someone who's actually been there.

If you're planning a trip and find something useful here, that's great. If you've been to these places and have your own thoughts, even better.

## How this is organized

Each region file is pretty loose in structure—places are added as I find them, not in any particular order. I try to include basic details like location, what makes it interesting, and sometimes a note about timing or practical considerations if someone mentioned them.

## A word about the information

Since these come from various online sources, I can't vouch for accuracy of details like opening hours or current conditions. It's more about capturing what seemed appealing at the time. Always double-check practical info before making plans.

## What might come next

I add to this as I discover new places online. Eventually I might include:

- Photos from people who've been there, if I find good ones to include
- Maps, when I figure out a good way to include them
- More detailed notes about what makes each place interesting
- Additional regions as I get around to visiting them
