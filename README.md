# Japan Travel Spots

*A quiet collection of places I'd like to visit in Japan*

I save interesting Japanese spots I find online here—usually from social media posts or travel blogs that pop up in my feed. This repository is where I keep them organized, mostly for my own reference, but perhaps they'll be useful to someone else who stumbles upon this.

These aren't comprehensive guides or must-see lists—just places I found interesting enough to save for later. Some are well-known, others less so. All seemed worth bookmarking for a future trip.

## Destinations

- [Tokyo](./kanto/Tokyo.md) - The capital's many faces
- [Osaka](./kansai/Osaka.md) - Good food and friendly people
- [Kyoto](./kansai/Kyoto.md) - Old temples and quiet gardens
- [Nara](./kansai/Nara.md) - Deer parks and ancient stories
- [Hokkaido](./others/Hokkaido.md) - Northern landscapes and fresh air
- [Okinawa](./others/Okinawa.md) - Island time and clear waters

## A few notes

Each file contains places I've collected online, along with whatever details seemed worth saving at the time. Nothing fancy—just locations, brief descriptions, and the occasional note from someone who's actually been there.

If you're planning a trip and find something useful here, that's great. If you've been to these places and have your own thoughts, even better.

## What might come next

I add to this as I discover new places online. Eventually I might include:

- Photos, if I remember to take decent ones
- Maps, when I figure out a good way to include them
- More detailed notes about what makes each place interesting
- Additional regions as I get around to visiting them
